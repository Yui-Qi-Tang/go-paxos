# go-paxos

I had studied Paxos algorithm, but had did not implement it, so that's the reason why this project does exist.

我曾經研究過Paxos演算法，但我不曾實做過它，這就是這個專案為什麽會存在的原因。

Thanks for open course from MIT http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2015/labs/lab-3.html, I learn a lot of techiques from the lab-3 and let me be able to implement Paxos algorithm.

很感謝MIT的公開課程，我在lab-3學到很多技巧並讓我有能力去實做它。

Thanks!
